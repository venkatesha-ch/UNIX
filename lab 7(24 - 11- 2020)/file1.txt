We’ll start with gzip a very popular program,that works with one or more
filenames.It provides the extension .gz to the compressed filename and
removes the original file.
• In the following example we run gzip on the file libc.html. We also note
the file size ,both before and after compression using wc –c which counts
characters.
$wc –c libc.html
3875302 libc.html
$gzip libc.html
$wc –c libc.html.gz
788096 libc.html.gz
